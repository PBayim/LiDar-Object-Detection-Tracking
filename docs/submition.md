# 1. Introduction 

Autonomous driving systems rely heavily on robust sensing modalities, with LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) emerging as a cornerstone technology for environmental perception. The Blickfeld Cube 1 LiDAR, with its compact form factor and extensive detection range, aims to address the challenges of detection, tracking, and real-time decision-making. In this use case, we will first review the device by exploring its key specififications and evaluate how their alighment with self-driving car requirments. Further, we will outline the implementation process in Python, including initial sanity testing and the development of object detection and tracking algorithms. 

## 1.1 Overview of the Blickfeld Cube 1 specifications 

### Physical Characteristics 
- Dimensions: 60 x 82 x 50 mm
- Wight: 275 g

The sensors7s relatively small size and moderate weight enable flexible mounting options. For self-driving vehicles, compact sensors reduce aerodynamic drag, simplify placement (e.g, rooftop, bumper, or side mirrors), and help maintain an unobtrusivve exterior design (Seif & Hu, 2016). 

### Detection capabilities
- Detection range:  5m ~ 250m
- Range resolution: < 1cm
- Range precision: < 2cm

In autonomous driving, reliable detection up to at least 200m is commonly desired, particularly for highway scenarios where vehicles travel at higher speeds. The Blickfeld Cube 1 meets this criterion by offering a maximum range of 250m, which is suitable for a wide variety of driving conditions (Blickfeld GmbH, 2023). The high range resolution (< 1cm) and precision (< 2cm) are advantageous for differentiating closely spaced objects and accurately interpreting the surrounding environment (Levinson & Thrun, 2010). 

### Field of view (FoV)
- Horizontal: 70°
- Vertical: 30° 

A wide field of view (FoV) is essential for autonomous vehicles to minimize blind spots. While the 70° horizontal range is narrower than some 120° LiDAR models available, its configurable scanning patterns can effectively focus on critical regions—such as detecting obstacles directly ahead or monitoring blind spots. The 30° vertical FoV can be adjusted for specific detection patterns, providing appropriate coverage for various height ranges including vehicles and pedestrians (Blickfeld GmbH, 2023).

### Performance 
- Scanlines: > 500 per second
- Frame Rate: 1 – 30 Hz
- Wavelength: 900 nm

A frame rate of up to 30 Hz aligns well with real-time processing requirements for autonomous systems, where high temporal resolution is essential to track fast-moving objects accurately. The scanning density (> 500 scanlines/s) further enriches the point cloud, improving the fidelity of environmental models (Teichman et al., 2013). The 900 nm wavelength is in the near-infrared range, commonly used in automotive LiDAR to balance sensitivity and eye safety (Blickfeld GmbH, 2023).

## 1.2 Alignment with Self-driving Car requirements 

### Range and Precision
- Requirement: Detect objects beyond typical stopping distances and at highway speed (ranging from approximately 150m to over 250)
- Blickfeld Cube 1 Alignment: With a specified maximum range of 250m, the Cube 1 meets this requirement for both urban and highway scenarios. The subcentimeter resolution further enhances object classification accurary (Levinson & Thrun, 2010). 

### Field of View
- Requirement: Broad coverage is needed to observed traffic in adjacent lanes, pedestrians, and obstacles with minimal blind spots. 
- Blickfeld Cube 1 Alignment: A 70° horizontal FoV may necessitate multiple sensors or carefully planned sensor placements for comprehensive coverage. However, for many operational design domains, 70° can be sufficient if complemented with additional sensors or strategic mounting. Its flexible vertical scanning pattern allows adaptation to specific operational needs (Seif & Hu, 2016). 

### Frame rate and Point Density
- Requirement: Hgher frame rates (20-30Hz or more) are typically desired for dynamic scenes. A sufficiently dense point cloud aids in precise obstacle detection and tracking. 
- Blickfeld Cube 1 Alignment: The 1-30Hz adjustable frame rate offers the flexibility to balance point cloud density with computational overhead. Over 500 scanlines per second produce a point cloud of respectable density, supporting reliable perception tasks (Teichman et al., 2011)
